# Fruits
Python script which identifies and counts fruits (oranges, bananas, apples) from image based on their HSV values.

You can find images that I have been working with in the /data folder.
Results are printed after running the code.

Correct final result:
<p align="center">
  <img width="542" height="208" src="./readme_files/result.png">
</p>
